# Chess-Game-with-Minimax-Algorithm-Engine
This project is a fully functional chess game that pits a human player against an artificial intelligence opponent. Developed with Pygame, the application provides a complete and responsive visual interface, allowing for intuitive drag-and-drop piece movement and a clear representation of the game state.

The AI's logic is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, a foundational decision-making strategy in game theory. This algorithm enables the AI to think ahead by constructing a "game tree" of possible future moves and counter-moves. Using a heuristic evaluation function, it scores the potential outcomes of each move, allowing it to select the action that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the human player's advantage. This process effectively simulates strategic foresight.

As a case study, this project offers clear insights into AI behavior within deterministic, perfect-information games. It highlights the core mechanics of adversarial search algorithms and heuristic design, which are crucial for developing intelligent systems. The principles demonstrated here are not limited to games; they build foundational knowledge for real-world AI applications in fields such as robotics, strategic financial modeling, and automated logistics planning.
