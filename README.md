# Chess-Game-with-Minimax-Algorithm-Engine
This project is a fully functional chess game that pits a human player against an artificial intelligence opponent. Developed with Pygame, the application provides a complete and responsive visual interface, allowing for intuitive drag-and-drop piece movement and a clear representation of the game state.
